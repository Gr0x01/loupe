# Competitors

## Landkit (landkit.pro)

**Main competitor** — same ICP (vibe coders), different timing.

### Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **URL** | landkit.pro |
| **Founder** | Nikhil (976 followers on X, India) |
| **Founded** | December 2025 |
| **Positioning** | "Linter for landing page conversion" |
| **Target** | "The 'Overwhelmed Marketer' who needs speed" |

**Value prop (from TrustMRR):**
> AI builders like Lovable and Bolt are brilliant at coding, but they don't know marketing. Landkit generates the psychological strategy, ICP-tuned copy, and structural prompts you need to turn visitors into revenue.

### Revenue (TrustMRR, Feb 9 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| All-time revenue | $1,997 |
| MRR (estimated) | $339 |
| Active subscriptions | 25 |
| Trend | Down 69% vs prev period |

Revenue spiked ~$1k around Jan 31 - Feb 2, then dropped back to baseline ~$300/mo.

### Claimed Numbers (Reddit posts)

**Post 1** (~5-7 days ago, "30 days later"):
- 16,000 unique visitors
- 3,000 audits processed
- "80-90% of users coming back"
- "Made it to TrustMRR leaderboard"
- "API costs burning my pocket"

**Post 2** (16 hours ago, "last month"):
- 10,000+ visitors
- 2,400+ audits processed
- $0 ad spend

### Reality Check

**The numbers don't add up:**
- Visitors went from 16k → 10k between posts
- Audits went from 3k → 2.4k between posts
- Numbers went BACKWARDS in a later post covering the same period

**"80-90% coming back" vs reality:**
- Only 25 paying customers
- MRR down 69% from peak
- If retention was 80-90%, revenue wouldn't crater

**Pattern:** Inflating numbers for Reddit engagement. Classic indie hacker growth theater.

### Landkit vs Loupe

| Aspect | Landkit | Loupe |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Timing** | Before you ship | After you ship |
| **Core value** | Generate better copy | Know if changes worked |
| **Output** | Suggestions, blueprints | Correlations, predictions |
| **Metric model** | Score (88/100) | Impact predictions |
| **Ongoing value** | Generate more content | Watch + correlate |
| **Category** | "Linter for conversion" | "Change Intelligence" |

### Landkit's Gap = Loupe's Opportunity

Landkit tells you what to *try*. It cannot tell you if it *worked*.

- No correlation layer
- No feedback loop
- No continuous monitoring
- You follow their suggestions → conversions go up or down → no idea which change caused what

**Natural positioning:**
> "Landkit writes the headline. Loupe tells you if it converted."

Or complementary framing: Landkit is the "before," Loupe is the "after."

## UX Audit (tryuxaudit.com)

### UX Audit vs Loupe

| Aspect | UX Audit | Loupe |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Core job** | "Grade my UX" (point-in-time) | "What changed and did it help?" (longitudinal) |
| **Output** | Scored PDF report | Timeline + metric correlation |
| **Audience** | Designers, agencies | Solo founders, vibe coders |
| **Value model** | Bulk audits (credits) | Ongoing monitoring (pages) |
| **Repeat value** | Manual re-audit | Auto-scans, auto-correlates |
| **Moat** | Low — checklist audit is commoditized | Change-to-outcome correlation |

### Assessment

They validate the market for AI audits but aren't solving the same problem. They audit UX heuristics; Loupe connects changes to outcomes. Their existence sharpens Loupe's positioning: *"UX Audit tells you what's wrong. Loupe tells you what worked."*

**Where they could pull attention:** Agency/team tier, white-label PDFs, multi-page crawling.
