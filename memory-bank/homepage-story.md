# Homepage Story

**Goal:** Get a URL into the input field.

**Tone:** Celebration + curiosity. "You're shipping. Let's see what's landing."

**Throughline:** Every section is about YOU — your work, your page, your results, your future.

---

## Structure (4 sections)

| # | Section | Beat | File |
|---|---------|------|------|
| 1 | Hero | You ship fast. That's the hard part. Now see what's working. | `page.tsx` |
| 2 | Your Page | Here's what Loupe sees when it looks at your page. | `YourPage.tsx` (was HowItWorks) |
| 3 | Your Results | Here's what you learn — which changes helped, which didn't. | `YourResults.tsx` (was ScenarioShowcase) |
| 4 | Closer | Your next change is coming. This time, you'll know. | `UrgencyCloser.tsx` |

**Note:** Compounding intelligence (Layer 3) is seeded lightly: "Every scan makes Loupe sharper." Full compounding messaging lives in onboarding emails, dashboard, and retention flows — not the acquisition page.

## Section 1: Hero

**Qualifier:** For founders who ship fast

**Headline:**
> You made the change.
> See what it did.

**Subhead:**
> You write the headline, hit deploy, move on. Loupe watches what happens next and tells you if it worked.

**Trust line:** Free. No signup. Results in 30 seconds.

**Founding 50:** X of 50 founding spots claimed.

**Visual:** SitePreviewCard (right column on desktop)

## Section 2: Your Page

**Headline:** Your page, through Loupe

**Purpose:** Show what YOU see — a preview of the audit output. Your headline, your CTA, your findings. Make it feel like looking in a mirror, not reading a process diagram.

**Content:**
- Mini preview of audit output (findings card, predictions)
- "Loupe reads your headline, layout, and CTA"
- "You get specific findings — not a generic checklist"
- Shows: what Loupe notices, what it predicts, what it suggests

**Key shift from old "How It Works":** Instead of explaining Loupe's process (paste → watch → answers), show what the user gets. Outcome-focused, not mechanism-focused.

---

## Section 3: Your Results

**Headline:** Your changes. Your answers.

**Purpose:** Show what YOUR results look like over time. The timeline. The verdict. The clarity of "this helped / this didn't."

**Content:**
- Timeline visual: change → outcome connection
- Verdict examples: "Your headline change helped." / "Your pricing tweak didn't."
- Keep it about "your" — even if examples are illustrative

**Key shift from old "Evidence":** Instead of showing other people's scenarios (via Lovable, via Bolt), show what YOUR dashboard/results would look like. The examples can be illustrative, but framed as "here's what you'll see" not "here's what happened to someone else."

**Tool logos:** Still show Lovable, Bolt, v0, etc. as identity anchors — but as a subtle bar, not the focus.

---

## Section 4: Closer

**Headline:**
> Your next change is coming.
> This time, you'll know.

**Subhead:**
> Start with a free audit. It becomes the baseline Loupe watches against.

**Trust line:** No signup. No credit card. Just paste your URL.

**Scarcity:** X of 50 founding spots remaining.

## Language Rules

**Use:**
- "change" or "update" not "deploy" alone
- "signups" not "conversion rate"
- "your page" not "your website"
- "your AI" for vibe coder actions
- Active voice, present tense, second person
- Curiosity framing: "see what it did", "find out which ones"
- Celebration of velocity: "you ship fast", "you made the change"

**Avoid:**
- "AI-powered", "intelligent", "smart"
- "Monitor your site" (uptime language)
- "Visual regression", "QA"
- "Correlation layer", "Change Intelligence" (internal jargon)
- Emojis, exclamation marks in headlines
- "Coin flip" / gambling metaphors
- Fear-based framing ("you're losing money", "costing you signups")
- Punching down at founders for not tracking changes
- Making the reader feel bad about their current workflow

## What We Cut

- **Gap section** (alone vs. with Loupe) — message absorbed into hero subhead
- **Trust section** (trigger quotes) — no real quotes yet
- **Pages audited counter** — only 1 page audited (me)
- **Experiential preview** — nice-to-have, can add later

## What's Real vs. Hypothetical

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Free audit | Real — works |
| Founding 50 counter | Real — live from DB |
| Results examples | Illustrative — "here's what you'll see", not "this happened to someone" |
| Integration logos | Real — Loupe integrates with these tools |
